There will be a time in ones life when one has to search something on google and wondered only if I could have some more functionality to refine my search. Well there is but for those who seek, will find it.

Google is a very powerfull tool for the ones who know how to use it. I myself was unaware of some of theses and got to know it when I was presented with a problem. 

## The operators
### Minus `-`
Consider a situation where you are trying to search for `best laptop` but you are not interested in Apple products so instead of searching `best laptops` you can search `best laptops -apple` and you will only be presented with the best of windows laptops.

### Quotations `""`
This is particularly useful when you want to preserve the oder of the search. Results of `"heavy off road vehicals"` will be different from `heavy off road vehicals`. This technique is refered to as *Exact Search*

### Search a single website.
There are ocassions when we just want to find a particular thing on a single website. Consider during *Black Friday* you want to search `amazon.com` and not some other shaddy website which is offering a brand new iPhone for very cheap. Hence, if we want to search a product only on amazon then we can do something like this `iPhone site:amazon.com`. This will ensure that your search will be performed on amazon and you wont be shown or at least the first results will be from amazon.

### Search for page title or on page title
`Germany intitle =BMW` and it will return sites that are about germany and have a title BMW in it. Also, there is `allintitle =<words>` which can be used for multiple words.

### Search in URLs
Similar to the above one, you can search for words if they appear in the URL with `inurl:<words>` and `allinurl:<words>`

### Search Text on a site
If you want to search for some text phrases on a website then you can do this by `intext:<word>` and `allintext:<words>`.

### Search for file types
If you want to search for downloadable files, you can do it by `filetype:<pdf/txt...etc>`. Example: `ISO 9001 filetype:pdf`

### Related website
This has happened to all of us. We like a website and we want to see what other options are available to us. In that case we can use `related:<known website of interest>`. Example: `related:distrowatch.org`

### Placeholders
This has to be one of the most interesting one of all. Did it ever happen to you that you forgot a few words of a lyric or a quote or a film dialoge? You can search google with a placeholder just for this purpose. Example: `Life is like a * *, you never know what you are gonna get`. The `*` are refered as palceholders. You place it at either side of the forgotten words or phrases and you are pretty much done.

### Time restrictions
This filter is particularly useful when you want to restrict information before or after certiain time period. Particularly useful in case of news articles. To use this option `Tools > Any time` and then select anytime that one wants.
