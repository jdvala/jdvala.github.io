# Notes 3

**Question**: What is *Stochastic Process*?

**Answer**: A *Stochastic Process* is one that generates numbers with certain probability distribution (The word *Stochastic* simply means probablistic or randomly generated, but it is commonly used in case when referring to a sequence of results assumed to be generated by some underlying probability distribution.)

**Question**: What is *Bernoulli trail*?

**Answer**: A random expriment with exactly two results, *success* or *failure*. 

**Question**: What is a *Probabilty Mass Function*?

**Answer**: Random variables have numeric range hence it is easy to do maths on them rather than doing them on events representing those variables. So we can define a *Probability Mass Function* of pmf for a random variable which gives out the probability that random variable have different values.

**Question**: What is *Expectation*?

**Answer**: The *expectation* is the mean of the random variable. So if $X$ is a random variable with pmf $p(x)$ such that $\sum_x\|x\|p(x) < \infty$, then expectation is 

$$E(X) = \sum_xx p(x)$$

>Example: If rolling one die and Y is the value on it face, what is the expectation?

**Solution**: We have total of 6 possibilties, hence $p(y) =\frac{1}{6}$

$$E(Y) = \sum_{1}^{6} y \frac{1}{6}$$

$$E(Y) = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{1}^{6} y$$

$$E(Y)= \frac{21}{6} = 3\frac{1}{2}$$


**Question**: What is *Varience*?

**Answer**: The *varience* of a random number is the measure of whether the values if the random variable tends to be consistent over trails or vairy a lot. 

In terms of *expectation*, *varience* can be found by how much on an average the variable's value deviate frim the variables expectation level.

$$Var(X) = E((X-E(X))^2)$$

$$Var(X)= E(X)^2 - E^2(X)$$

**Question**: What is *Standard Deviation*?

**Answer**: It is the square root of *varience*. It is denoted by $\sigma$


>Example: What is *Expectation and Varience* of the sum of two unbaised dice rolls? $S = \{2,3,...,12\}$


**Solution**: Expectation is given in the formula above, let $E(X)$ be the Expectation of the sum of roll of two dices and $E(Y)$ be the Expectation of roll of one die$.


$$E(X) = E(Y) + E(Y)$$ 

which is calculate above, 

$$E(X) = 3\frac{1}{2} +3\frac{1}{2} = 7$$

and Varience becomes

$$Var(X) = E((X-E(X))^2)$$

As we already know $E(X) = \sum_xx p(x)$ substituting it in above formula we get,

$$Var(X) = E((X -\sum_xp(x))^2)$$

$$Var(X) = \sum_x p(x)(x-\sum_xp(x)^2)$$

$$Var(X) = \frac{35}{6}$$
