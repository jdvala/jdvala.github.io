Hey, Thanks for dropping by. Let me introduce myself, if you want to look more closely at my resume, click here.
I am Jay Vala, I am a currently working as a Junior Data Scientist at Scoutbee GmbH, I have a Master's in Digital Engineering from Otto-Von-Guricke University Magdeburg in Germany. My interest are Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I also love the challenges in data acquisition and ETL pipelines. The main reason I started writing this blog is because I tend to forget things if I just do it once, also I wanted to document everything for my Master thesis. I don't remember who said this but, "Writing once is equal to reading several times".

So enjoy

If you find mistakes in the post or have a suggestion, please drop me an email at `jay.vala@msn.com`

4. **Feel Good News**

Tell me why is the media so negative? - Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam. While media houses are doing less, we chose to prioritize optimism over gloom. Feel Good News app filters the negative news and provides positive news inducing a good feeling. The app takes advantage of the advancements in AI and Machine Learning to filter out texts that seem negative and gloomy. News intertwined with social media in a globalized economy is a product which thrives on sensationalism, negativity, polarization, fake news, agendas and propaganda. The obvious casualty is the truth and all the good that is happening around us. In all the challenges the present has thrown at us, there is enough to celebrate and inspire. While media houses are not doing anything, we chose to prioritize optimism over gloom. Feel Good News looks at the sunnier side and reinforces the good in each one of us. A small encouragement is all that is required to propel the human spirit to triumph in testing times. Start of your day with Feel Good News and commence your journey of a better day and a better world.
