Aim: The aim of this model is to classify sentences. I am going to use Recurrent Neural Network for this purpose, specifically LSTMs. LSTMs have an advantage compared to simple RNN cell or GRU cell. You can learn about LSTMs and RNNs, There is no point on going in detail here. May be I will write another post wherein I will describe RNNs and LSTMs more intutively, but for today these two links will suffice.</description></item></channel></rss>
