The most efficent way of removing those long sentences, and making them suitable for learning was making it of a fixed length.
I have used a technique called Sliding Window Protocol here is the brief example of how this is used here for breaking long sentences into smaller ones of fixed size.</description></item><item><title>Data Discrepancies</title><link>https://jdvala.github.io/posts/2018-05-16-data-discrepancies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdvala.github.io/posts/2018-05-16-data-discrepancies/</guid><description>Analysizing Discrepancies in Dataset a lot of discrepancies in the dataset created previously, I can to realize that when I was building the model. I always analyze the dataset before building the model because 90% of the time people don&amp;rsquo;t realize that their model is performing bad because their data was bad. I am not gonna let that happen.
So what all discrepancies I found?
The largest sequence was of 242 words.</description></item></channel></rss>
