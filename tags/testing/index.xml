Writing test for code can quickly go out of hand if there are a huge number of conditions in the code, which in general there is. I recently came across such a situation where my code was 200 lines and the tests I wrote for it were 400 lines 🙈. I know it was too much but I have this practice where in I want to have 100% of test coverage.</description></item></channel></rss>
